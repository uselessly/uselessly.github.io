        <h2 id="galapagos">Galapagos?</h2>
        <p><strong>The Galápagos Islands may just inspire you to think differently about the world. The creatures that call the islands home, many found nowhere else in the world, act as if humans are nothing more than slightly annoying paparazzi.</strong><br>This is not the Bahamas and these aren’t typical tropical paradises; in fact, most of the islands are devoid of vegetation and some look more like the moon than Hawaii. However, more humans live here than is commonly assumed, and there’s a surprising level of development in the islands’ towns, mostly geared toward the thriving tourism industry.<br>This isolated group of volcanic islands and its fragile ecosystem has taken on almost mythological status as a showcase of biodiversity. Yet you don’t have to be an evolutionary biologist or an ornithologist to appreciate one of the few places left on the planet where the human footprint is kept to a minimum.<br>Source:https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ecuador/the-galapagos-islands (20/09/2018)</p>

        <h2 id="chile">Chile?</h2>
        <p><strong>From the Far North and the Altiplano to the Far South of Chile, someone is always waiting to receive you with open arms.</strong><br>Chile has many different adventures to offer tourists: stargazing in the driest desert in the world, millennial glaciers in the southernmost part of the planet, enchanted forests, and lakes located at the foot of massive volcanoes. It has islands full of legends, winemaking traditions, great challenges to be overcome, and the modern and accessible city of Santiago.<br>But, there is something about Chile that has not yet been said. Chile has wide-open natural landscapes, but you can also find this openness in the Chilean people. The feeling of being alive floods over you in these wide-open spaces in Chile. Here you can get in touch with nature or set out to explore pristine areas. The people of Chile will also pleasantly surprise you with their kindness and hospitality. This will be a completely new experience in a place where you will feel at peace.<br>source:http://chile.travel/en# (20/09/2018)</p>
